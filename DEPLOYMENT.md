# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## The Problem
The `config.js` file was listed in `.gitignore`, which means it wasn't being committed to your GitHub repository. When GitHub Pages tried to load the file, it returned a 404 error.

## The Solution
I've fixed this by:

1. **Removed `js/config.js` from `.gitignore`** - Now the config file will be included in your repository
2. **Made the config.js GitHub Pages ready** - It no longer contains hardcoded API keys
3. **Added user-friendly API key handling** - Users can provide their own API keys

## How It Works Now

### For Users Visiting Your Site:
1. If no API key is found, a modal will appear asking them to enter their OpenWeatherMap API key
2. They can get a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
3. The API key gets stored in their browser's localStorage for future visits

### Alternative Method - URL Parameter:
Users can also visit your site with the API key in the URL:
```
https://yourusername.github.io/Weather_website/?api_key=THEIR_API_KEY_HERE
```

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Commit and push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix config.js for GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages** (if not already done):
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Scroll to "Pages" section
   - Select source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose branch: "main" and folder: "/ (root)"
   - Save

3. **Test your deployment**:
   - Visit your GitHub Pages URL
   - The app should prompt for an API key
   - Enter a valid OpenWeatherMap API key
   - The weather app should work normally

## For Local Development

If you want to develop locally without entering the API key each time:

1. Copy `js/config.local.js` to create a local config
2. Add your API key to the local file
3. The `.gitignore` is set up to not commit this local file

## Security Notes

✅ **Good**: No API keys are committed to the public repository
✅ **Good**: Users provide their own API keys
✅ **Good**: API keys are stored locally in browser only
✅ **Good**: OpenWeatherMap allows client-side API usage for free tier

This setup is perfect for GitHub Pages and follows best practices for API key security!
